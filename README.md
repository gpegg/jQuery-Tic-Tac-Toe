# jQuery-Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple jQuery project I put together where you can play tic-tac-toe

I created this tic-tac-toe game after watching jQuery basics on Treehouse.com and using mainly jQuery. First, I define all variables using ES6 standards. Second I set up the main function used for the game, which needs simplification. This function tracks the tiles checked and: 1. does not allow a tile to be checked twice. 2. if all tiles are check and there is no winner, end the game. 3. If 3 tiles in a row/column/diagonal line are checked, check if the winner is 'X' or 'O' and inform the players of the winner. There is also the rules dropdown, but that is super simple.

The code needs to be simplified, but it works as it should and I have other projects to work on, so that is on the backburner.
